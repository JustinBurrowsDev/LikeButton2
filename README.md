# React Like Button

## Challenges I Faced?

This is my first time using react, while I am familiar with JavaScript HTML and CSS to some degree I need to be cognizant of the differences and requirements while learning to use this new library.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

By leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, bootcamps and reference guides I was able to find the proper methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the like button accordingly.

## What Did I Learn? 

* The basics on using React
* How do use the Terminal to create a react application
* Basics on using yarn in the terminal to test react applications
* Basics on react hooks
